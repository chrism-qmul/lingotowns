The desire to learn from the past faded away and previously globally connected cultures became isolated. Surviving documents from the 21st century had been unearthed in every town and city and the future humans believed these documents would teach them their shared history and help unite them in their understanding of their present.</p>

In a daring experiment a group of future scientists have transported you and a few others into their present, in the hope that you will teach them the final elements of 21st century language they can't yet grasp, to allow their civilisation to progress</p>
